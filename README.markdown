Puppet Environment Manager
=================================

A simple prototype, hopefully.

Questions:
* How do we keep the defined resource types/classes from being resolved into builtin resources?
* How do we map applications to nodes?
* How do we get a node's mapped application into the node's catalog?

Things to build:
* 'environment' application
* app to node mapper, preferably with graph awareness
* function for pulling apps into node catalogs
